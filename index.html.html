<h1>MY JOURNEY AS A WEB DEVELOPER</h1>
When Sarah first dipped her toes into web development, she was intimidated by the sea of programming languages, frameworks, and tools
. Her journey started simply—learning HTML and CSS through free online tutorials. 
At first, she was excited by the power of building something from scratch, even if it was just a basic webpage with a few images and text.
After a few months, Sarah began to feel limited.
 She wanted her websites to be interactive—buttons that changed colors when clicked, forms that actually submitted data. 
So, she dove into JavaScript. It was challenging, but also rewarding when she saw her first "Hello, World!" appear in the console.
